## University Options

Ideally, I'd like to go to university in New South Wales (Australia), either the University of Sydney or the University of New South Wales.

Both of these universities rank well on Australian comparisons and fit into the area I plan to stay in the future.

## Courses

Some courses that I'm interested in include:

 - Penis removal
 - Sexual orientation research
 - Education failures in society
 - Asian study characteristics and stereotypes
 - Females gaining too much power in society
 - Corruption by HP in selling laptops to schools
 - Homeschooling disadvantages and why we should murder parents
 - Reading gives power. Power corrupts.
 - MISTER MISTER MISTER???
