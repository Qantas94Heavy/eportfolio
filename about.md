<div class="row">
  My name's Karl, and I'm a student at AISHK (Australian International School Hong Kong).
  
  ## Interests and Hobbies
  
  I'm interested in issues issues concerning equality, as well as rights and privileges granted to certain groups in society.
  Education research is something that I'm keen to look into, to help myself understand problems with current teaching practices
  and ways to help myself learn regardless of these issues.    I'm also not bad at public speaking and debating, and play tennis
  on Saturdays to stay active.
  
  In my free time I create various websites and applications; my favourite programming language is JavaScript,
  followed closely by Python (it would be if I could use it client-side).
  
  ## About me
  
  Though I'm not exactly the type of person who's ridiculously popular, I'm not afraid to speak out about my personal
  opinion on contraversial topics. I'm always on the lookout for new ways to do things, and I'm not the type of person to stick to old methods
  just because they've worked in the past.
