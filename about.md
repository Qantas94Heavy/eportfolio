## About me

My name's Karl Cheng, and I'm a Year 10 student (equivalent of Form 4) at the Australian International School Hong Kong.

I'd like to consider myself as quirky, inquisitive and strong-minded.

I'm always on the lookout for new ways to do things, and I'm not the type of person to stick to old methods just because they've worked in the past.

It's especially self-motivating when my work is actually appreciated by someone in the real world. I also find it useful to be interested in the general field of the subject I'm learning about.

In my free time I create various websites and applications. 

### Skills and Interests

In my free time I:

 - Participate in an after-school debating club at school (being unafraid to provide my opinion on contraversial topics does help).
 - Go to tennis class on the weekends to stay active.
 - 


### Programming

My favourite programming language is JavaScript, followed closely by Python (it would be if I could use it client-side). I don't know too many other programming languages, though I'm currently learning how to use Rust, which requires quite a different mindset.
