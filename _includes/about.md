## About me

My name's Karl Cheng, and I'm a Year 10 student (equivalent of Form 4) at the Australian International School Hong Kong.

I'm always on the lookout for new ways to do things, and I love to learn about new developments in ideas. It's especially self-motivating when my work is actually appreciated by someone in the real world. I also find it useful to be interested in the general field of the subject I'm learning about.

### Skills and Interests

In my free time I:

 - Participate in an after-school debating club at school (being unafraid to provide my opinion on contraversial topics does help).
 - Go to tennis classes on the weekend to stay active.
 - Create various websites and applications in JavaScript, HTML and CSS.
 
I'm also interested in the aviation industry, as well as being an avid supporter of civil rights, such as free speech.

### Programming

My favourite programming language is JavaScript, followed closely by Python (it would be if I could use it client-side). I don't know too many other programming languages, though I'm currently learning how to use Rust, which requires quite a different mindset.

You can see a few of my works in my [portfolio](portfolio.html).
