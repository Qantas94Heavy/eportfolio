## Self Evaluation
### About me

**Q: What makes you different?**

A: Unlike other people, I'm not afraid to try out something different. I'm not afraid to learn new things, and it's especially self-motivating when I'm interested in the general field of the subject I'm learning about.

**Q: What are three adjectives that describe yourself?**

A: I'd say that I'm quirky, inquisitive and strong-minded.

**Q: What is your family like?**

A: My family's fairly conservative. However, my parents both respect most of the decisions that I've taken in life, though there's been ups and downs in family relationships.

**Q: What values are important to you?**

A: Most important to me is the notion of respecting one another as equals -- I believe that's the foundation of a good relationship between people.

### Interests

**Q: What extra-curricular activities are you involved in?**

A: I play tennis on the weekends, and I'm a member of a debating group that meets up after school weekly.

**Q: What do you do in your spare time?**

A: I try and learn new things about subjects I'm interested in when I can to be able to get ahead in my understanding. I also like to do hobbies such as programming.

### Strengths

**Q: What school subjects do you like?**

A: It depends what you mean. In general, I'm not too much of a fan of the way courses are taught in junior high school courses. However, I find [...] interesting, despite my lack of skills in the area.

**Q: What are you good at?**

A: I'm good at mathematics, science and public speaking.

**Q: What do you feel most comfortable doing?**

I feel most comfortable when I'm able to show what I'm capable of over a long period of time.

**Q: What do you get complimented on the most?**

I'm often complimented on my ability to complete things quickly under a short turnaround, however for longer periods the improvement in quality is not that much.

**Q: What obstacles have you overcome?**

I've overcome being fearful of conceptual, artistic ideas, even though I'm not that good at them. This has been especially prevalent over the past two years with the Design and Technology subject at school.

### Weaknesses

**Q: What school subjects are hard for you?**

A: I find subjects such as art hard, as the forms of art performed at school don't really fit into my style of art, and I'm not too experienced with creating works of art. Though I have quite a few ideas, actually creating the work is much harder.

**Q: What is hard for you??**

A: I find it hard in situations where I'm asked to do something without knowing what is expected from the person asking for the job to be completed.

### Skills â€“ learning style

**Q: What is you learning style? Give examples of when you learn the best.**

A: I prefer to see things being done or to read about how it's done. I find it quite hard to just listen to something and be expected to perform it perfectly -- images and visuals help me significantly.
