  My name's Karl, and I'm a student at AISHK (Australian International School Hong Kong).
  
  <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
  
  I'm interested in issues issues concerning equality, as well as rights and privileges granted to certain groups
  in society. Education research is something that I'm keen to look into, to help myself understand problems
  with current teaching practices and ways to help myself learn regardless of these issues.
  
  I'm also not bad at public speaking and debating, and play tennis on Saturdays to stay active.
  
  In my free time I create various websites and applications; my favourite programming language is JavaScript,
  followed closely by Python (it would be if I could use it client-side).
  
  <h2>About me</h2>
  Though I'm not exactly the type of person who's ridiculously popular, I'm not afraid to speak out about my personal
  opinion on contraversial topics.
  
  I'm always on the lookout for new ways to do things, and I'm not the type of person to stick to old methods
  just because they've worked in the past.
  
  <h2>Strengths</h2>
  I'm good at mathematics, science and 
  
  If I'm interested in the topic, it's ridiculously easy for me to learn new things quickly and to gather motivation to
  apply this new-found knowledge in practical areas.
